<p>Yuemin was born in Chengdu, China.
More than two decades ago, she came to the United States to study for her PhD degree in Illinois, and then settled down on the East Coast.
Though her last name is HE, she is a female, not a male.
Her last name is pronounced as He, close to Ho, rather than Hee.
She likes reading and writing.
In her spare time, she watches movies, travels, gardens, and cooks.
Her Sichuan dishes are fantastic, and her dog is speedy.</p>
